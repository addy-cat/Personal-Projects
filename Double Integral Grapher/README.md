In Calculus 4, I learned about the concept of multiple integrals. The main (very incomplete) project I’m working on is a Unity application that deals with double integrals. In this case, there is a double integral of a function of two variables that the user may add limits of integration to. These integrals together with the limits represent the area (volume, because it’s 3-D) of the region bounded by the given function and four limits of integration. The program then graphs all given bounds and the function, then shades the correct region bounded by the function and all four limits. The scripts for this program are written in C#.

To-do:

-Implement region shading (hardest part)
